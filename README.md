**FenceKnot** is a **datapack** that **allows** you to put **knots** on your **fences** in an **easier** way than normal! ([no more sacrifices!](. "Usually you leash mobs and get rid of them :c"))

## Commands

`/trigger FenceKnot` puts a knot on the fence you're hugging.

`/trigger Switch_FK` enables or disables the capacity to put a knot on every fence you're hugging until you redo the command.
> disabled by default.
